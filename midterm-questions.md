## Lecture 5
### Page 7
* Could you please explain the error protocol?
### Page 10 
* For justifying that the angle is $\theta$ over two, would we say that adding a global phase allows us to reach all the points on the sphere, so we do not need to use the full angle of $\theta$? 

## Lecture 6
### Page 1
* Can you please explain how we can define the unitary by referring to itself?
* I do not understand how we can do this
### Page 2
* Where did we define $\beta$ to hold the probabilities of the second qubit?

## Lecture 7
### Page 3
* The resulting state is the projection onto what we are using to measure in a specific qubit since it either projects into that subspace or it does not?
### Page 7
* How do you disprove there are no hidden variables influencing the system (ask this after all the other questions)
### Page 8
* Does global probability mean that it is the same probability in all cases?

## Lecture 8
### Page 3
* Can you please explain how we obtained the expected value of $A_0B_0$? 
* I understand how we obtained the probabilities, but how are we determining the value of x to use for the expectation?

## Lecture 9
### Page 6
* Does it become 100% after renormalizing the vector?
### Page 14
* is the difference between a density matrix and a reduced density matrix whether we represent the spaces the global state or local state projects onto?
