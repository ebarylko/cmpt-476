Universality:   
* A gate set is universal (for classical computing) if $\forall n, m > 0$, any circuit can be constructed out of these gates

Correlated:
* A distribution is correlated if it cannot be written as the tensor product of two other states. it is Separable otherwise
* Similar to entanglement

Probability vector: 
* A vector where all the probabilities in the vector sum to 1
* Each probability is non-negative

Hermitian conjugate:
* Take the conjugate of the vector and then take the complex conjugate of each entry

Unitary:
* Hermitian conjugate is equal to its inverse
* Norm preserving

Projectors:
* An operator P with the property that $P^2$ = P
