## Question one
### The Bloch Sphere is a generalization of the representation of a complex number z with |z|^2 = 1 as a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. From this starting point, derive the equation of the Bloch sphere

I can represent a complex number z (a point on the bloch sphere) as a + bi, $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.

Using Euler's theorem, I can also represent z as $re^{i\theta}$.

Expanding out z, I find it is equivalent to $r(cos(\theta) + isin(\theta))$

I know that my point on the bloch sphere is a linear combination of 
$|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. Therefore, $z = $a|0\rangle$ + b|1\rangle, a, b \in \mathbb{C}$.
