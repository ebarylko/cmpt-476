## Question 1

Let $\beta$ = {$|A\rangle, |B\rangle$}


### Show that rotating the basis twice by θ is the same as rotating once by an angle of 2θ

The rotation matrix $R_{\theta}$ = 

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) \\
sing(\theta) & cos(\theta) \\
\end{bmatrix} $$

Rotating $\beta$ once by $\theta$ = 

{cos(θ)|A⟩ + sin(θ)|B⟩, − sin(θ)|A⟩ + cos(θ)|B⟩}

Rotating $\beta$ once more by theta results in the new basis
