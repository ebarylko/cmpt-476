Universality:   
* A gate set is universal (for classical computing) if $\forall n, m > 0$, any circuit can be constructed out of these gates

Correlated:
* A distribution is correlated if it cannot be written as the tensor product of two other states. it is Separable otherwise
* Similar to entanglement

Probability vector: 
* A vector where all the probabilities in the vector sum to 1
* Each probability is non-negative

Hermitian conjugate:
* Take the conjugate of the vector and then take the complex conjugate of each entry

Unitary:
* Hermitian conjugate is equal to its inverse
* Norm preserving

Projectors:
* An operator P with the property that $P^2$ = P pf

Partial measurement:
* Only measure and keep the states which have a qubit in the position you are looking at
* Normalize the resulting vector so it becomes a unit vector

Local operations:
* Measurements or operations done to a single qubit

Projective measurements: 
* Send a state $|\psi\rangle$ to $\frac{P_i|\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{p(i)}}$, where $p(i) = \langle\psi|P_i|\psi\rangle$

Hermitian:
* An operator p where $p^{\dagger} = p^{-1} = p$

Density matrix:
* Alternate representation of a mixed state
* Defined as
